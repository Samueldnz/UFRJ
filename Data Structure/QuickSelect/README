QuickSelect Version 1.0

This version of the QuickSelect program reads a file containing a list of numbers.
    To run the program, type the desired K position followed by the name of the file to be read.
    For example, to find the 5th smallest number in the "test.txt" file, run the command
    "./QuickSelect.exe 5 input.txt". 

    You can change the input.txt file for one of your own.

    Notes:
    - The file must contain only int separated by "\n".
    - The file must not contain any non-numeric characters.
    - The memory allocated for the dynamic int vector must be freed by the caller.
    
IMPORTANT: Remember that the K-th element is counted starting from the number 1.
