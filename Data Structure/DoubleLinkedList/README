DOUBLE LINKED LIST

In order to use the FIRST MAIN, you`ll need to enable uncommenting it. And to run the program, use the following command:
./doublelinkedlist.exe input.txt

Although, if you wanna direct the STDIN to the file, you will need to enable the SECOND MAIN. And to run the program, you`ll need to use the following command:
./doublelinkedlist.exe < "input.txt"

In both ones, there`s some lines used to clear the terminal. Check the corresponding lines below and, if you wish, delete them.

    printf("\nClick 'ENTER' to back to menu!\n"); -> lines 99, 168
    input_flush(); -> 100, 157
    system("clear"); -> lines 35, 101, 109, 169
    getchar(); -> lines 55, 63, 74, 124, 132, 170
