QuickSelect Version 2.0

This is the second version of the QuickSelect program. Since the program uses a static array to store 
the input data, it allows users to input a list of numbers via keyboard,

To use this program, you can run it in the command line and specify the value of K as 
an argument. 

For example, to find the K-th smallest element in a list, you can use 
the command:  
./QuickSelect.exe -K < "input.txt" 

 - "K" is replaced by the desired value
 - "input.txt" is a file containing the list of numbers.

Remember that the K-th element is counted starting from the number 1.*/
